# SERIES
-> Series is a function in pandas which creates a one dimensional arrays and can hold any type of objects or data types.

# DATAFRAMES
-> It is a two dimensional data structure which represents the data in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
-> It has 3 main principal components ie data , rows , columns

# loc method
-> We have to pass rows or columns names which we want to select
-> It can also accept boolean data
-> It can also retrive the info using indexing and slicing.

# iloc method
-> here we have to pass the integer index to select to select specific row and column
-> we can also use slicing.
-> Here we cannot pass rows or columns names to extract the data.

# HANDLING MISSING DATAFRAMES

@ isnull() and notnull()
-> isnull method is used to check if our data contains any nan value
-> It will return us True when nan is present and False when it is not present.

@ dropna()
-> This method is used to drop rows and columns that contains NaN values.

@ DATA MANIPULATION USING pandas

# Shape
-> It return the total number of rows and columns in the DATAFRAMES.

# Info()
-> It gives us the information of the dataframe like no of columns , columns labels , dtype , memory usage ,  non-null values.

# describe()
-> return the description of the data in dataframe like mean , median , std , min , max , count and etc.
-> It works only for numerical data by default
-> We can also use it for categorical data by using the parameter "include = 'all'".

@ 'GROUPING AND AGGREGATION'

# AGGREGATION
-> It is used to give us the summary of the column in the dataframe.
-> Use agg() method and mention all the parameter that you want to consider in agg.

# GROUP_BY
-> It is used to group the data based on some certain criteria from our dataset.
-> To view the formed groups we have to use first() method.

@ 'COMBINING THE DATA USING MERGE JOIN AND CONCAT'

# merge()
-> It is used to combine the data on common colums or indices

# join()
-> It is used to combine the data on common key columns or indices.
* join.outer() -> Return all rows if there is match is left or right dataframe
* join.inner() -> return the rows with the matching values in both dataframe.
* right.join() ->  all rows from right dataframe and matched rows from left df.
* left.join() -> all rows from left df and matched rows from right df.
* ignore_index() -> ignores the overlapping indexes.

# concat()
-> It combines the datframe across rows or columns.

@ HANDLING MISSIMG DATA
In pandas misiing data is represented by two value:
* NaN ->  special floating point recongnized by all the IEEE systems.
* None -> Pyhton singleton object that is often used for missing data.

Methods for handling the missing data
* isnull() -> Checkes whether the value is NaN or not
* notnull() -> Checkes whether the value is NaN or not	
* dropna() -> It drops the values contain NaN.
The above two methods return True if NaN value is present otherwise false.

# Filling the missing values

* fillna()
It has to methods to fill the missing value
- pad () -> filling the missing value with the previous one.
- bfill() -> filling the missing value wiht the next one.

* replace()
* interpolate() using linear method.
